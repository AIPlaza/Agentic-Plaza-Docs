Flowise is an open source generative AI development platform for building AI Agents and LLM workflows.

It offers a complete solution that includes:

- [x] Visual Builder
- [x] Tracing & Analytics
- [x] Evaluations
- [x] Human in the Loop
- [x] API, CLI, SDK, Embedded Chatbot
- [x] Teams & Workspaces

There are 3 main visual builders namely:

- Assistant
- Chatflow
- Agentflow

## Assistant

Assistant is the most begineer-friendly way of creating an AI Agent. Users can create chat assistant that is able to follow instructions, use tools when neccessary, and retrieve knowledge base from uploaded files ([RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)) to respond to user queries.

## Chatflow

Chatflow is designed to build single-agent systems, chatbots and simple LLM flows. It is more flexible than Assistant. Users can use advance techniques like Graph RAG, Reranker, Custom Code, etc.
