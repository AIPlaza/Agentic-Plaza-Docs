# Human In The Loop

In the previous tutorials, we explored how an Agent can dynamically use tools and automate execution. **Human-in-the-loop** adds a layer of control by allowing the Agent to request human input, approval, or feedback before proceeding.

There are 2 ways human in the loop can be used:

* Using [Human Input](../using-flowise/agentflowv2.md#id-11.-human-input-node) node to halt the execution
*   Enable **Require Human Input** for Agent's tools



## Human Input Node

The **Human Input** node allows execution to be paused and only resumed after a human has provided feedback to either approve or reject the action.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to create an automated email reply agent that asks for user feedback before sending out the email.

### Overview

The goal of this use case is to create an intelligent email reply system that:

1. Receives incoming email inquiries
2. Generates professional email responses using AI
3. Requests human approval before sending
4. Allows for revisions and improvements
5. Automatically sends the approved email

#### Step 1: Setting up the Start Node

1. Drag and drop the **Start** node onto the canvas. This will be the entry point for incoming email data.
2. Configure the Start node with the following settings:
   * **Input Type**: Select "Form Input" to capture structured email data
   * **Form Title**: "Email Inquiry"
   * **Form Description**: "Incoming email inquiry"
3. Add the following Form Input Types:
   * **Subject** (String): To capture the email subject line
   * **Body** (String): To capture the email content
   * **From** (String): To capture the sender's email address

#### Step 2: Creating the Email Reply Agent

1. Add an **Agent** node and connect it to the Start node. This agent will analyze the incoming email and generate an appropriate response.
2.  Add system message, for example:

    ```
    You are a customer support agent working in Flowise Inc. Write a professional email reply to user's query. Use the web search tools to get more details about the prospect.

    Always reply as Samantha, Customer Support Representative in Flowise. Don't use placeholders.
    ```
3. Add the following tools to enhance the agent's capabilities:
   * **Google Custom Search**: To research customer information and provide relevant context
   * **Current DateTime**: To include accurate timestamps in responses

#### Step 3: Adding Human Input for Approval

1. Add a **Human Input** node and connect it to the Email Reply Agent. This creates the human-in-the-loop checkpoint.
2. Configure the Human Input node:
   * **Description Type**: "Fixed"
   * **Description**: "Are you sure you want to proceed?"
   * **Enable Feedback**: True (allows humans to provide additional feedback)
3. This node will pause the workflow and present the AI-generated response to a human reviewer. The reviewer can either:
   * **Proceed**: Approve the response and continue to email sending
   * **Reject**: Send feedback and loop back to the agent for improvements

#### Step 4: Setting up the Loop Back Mechanism

1. Add a **Loop** node to handle rejection scenarios. This allows the workflow to return to the Email Reply Agent for improvements.
2. Configure the Loop node:
   * **Loop Back To**: Select "Email Reply Agent" from the dropdown
   * **Max Loop Count**: 5 (prevents infinite loops)
3. Connect the "reject" output from the Human Input node to this Loop node. When a human rejects the response, the workflow will return to the agent with the feedback for improvement.

#### Step 5: Creating the Email Subject & Body Generator

1. Add an **LLM** node and connect it to the "proceed" output of the Human Input node. This node will structure the approved response into proper email format.
2. Set up JSON Structured Output:
   * **Key**: "subject", **Type**: "string", **Description**: "Subject of the email"
   * **Key**: "body", **Type**: "string", **Description**: "Body of the email"

#### Step 6: Setting up Email Sending

1. Add a **Tool** node and connect it to the Email Subject & Body LLM node. This will handle the actual email sending.
2. Configure the Tool node:
   * **Tool**: Select "Gmail" from the available tools
   * **Message Actions**: "sendMessage"
3. Configure the tool input arguments:
   * **to**: Use the variable `{{ $form.from }}` to reply to the original sender
   * **subject**: Use `{{ llmAgentflow_0.output.subject }}` to get the generated subject from Step 5
   * **body**: Use `{{ llmAgentflow_0.output.body }}` to get the generated email body from Step 5

### How the Workflow Operates

When an email inquiry comes in, here's what happens:

1. **Form Input**: The system captures the email subject, body, and sender information
2. **AI Analysis**: The Email Reply Agent analyzes the inquiry and generates a professional response using web search for additional context
3. **Human Review**: The workflow pauses and presents the AI-generated response to a human reviewer
4. **Decision Point**: The human can either:
   * **Approve**: The response proceeds to email formatting and sending
   * **Reject**: The response returns to the agent with feedback for improvement
5. **Email Formatting**: If approved, the response is structured into proper email format with subject and body
6. **Email Sending**: The final email is automatically sent via Gmail to the original sender

### Testing the Workflow

1. Start the workflow by filling out the form with a sample email inquiry

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt="" width="527"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Review the Agent response in the Human Input step

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Reject the response and provide more feedback:

4. Review the revised response from Agent:

5. Proceed and verify that email is being sent correctly:

### How to let others to review

1. From the dashboard left side bar, click **Executions.**
2. Find the Execution trace, and click **Share.**

3. The execution trace is now available as a public link. You can share this link with others for review.

4. Users outside of Flowise can reject or approve:
