# Deployment

Flowise is built to be flexible, so you can deploy it wherever you're comfortable. We're platform-agnostic, meaning it works on a variety of systems:

***

### Local Machine

To deploy Flowise locally, follow our [Getting Started](../../getting-started/) guide.

### **Modern Cloud Providers**

Modern cloud platforms prioritize automation and a focus on developer workflows, simplifying cloud management and ongoing maintenance. This reduces the technical expertise needed, but may limit the level of customization you have over the underlying infrastructure.

### Established Cloud Providers

Established cloud providers, on the other hand, require a higher level of technical expertise to manage and optimize for your specific needs. This complexity, however, also grants greater flexibility and control over your cloud environment.
