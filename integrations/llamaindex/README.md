# LlamaIndex

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. It has advanced retrieval techniques for designing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) apps.

Flowise complements LangIndex by offering a visual interface. Here, all the necessary nodes are organized into distinct sections, making it easier to build workflows.
